Initially focused on affordable personal computers, Apple\\\\\\'s development of the Macintosh in 1984 revolutionized the industry. The company transitioned into a leading technology innovator with the introduction of products like the iPod in 2001, iPhone in 2007, iPad in 2010, Apple Watch in 2015, and a suite of complementary services including iTunes, the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. Today, Apple is renowned for its hardware products like the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, along with a robust services segment.\\\\n\\\\nApple, Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino, California, at its Apple Park campus. The company operates globally, with a significant presence in the United States, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and the Rest of Asia Pacific.\\\\n\\\\nFor the last reported quarter, which was the third quarter of fiscal 2023 ending on July 1, 2023, Apple generated revenues of $81.8 billion. The company\\\\\\'s EBITDA during this quarter was approximately $24.2 billion, equating to an EBITDA margin of 29.6%. As of the end of this fiscal quarter, Apple reported long-term debt of $98.6 billion on its balance sheet. Total leverage (defined as total debt to EBITDA) was approximately 1.0x, and net of the cash position (which was $55.9 billion in cash and marketable securities), Apple\\\\\\'s net leverage was approximately 0.64x. \\\\n\\\\nSources:\\\\n1.

       "<p>Background:</p>\n",
       "<p>Apple, Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino, California. Initially focused on affordable personal computers, Apple\\&#x27;s development of the Macintosh in 1984 revolutionized the industry. The company transitioned into a leading technology innovator with the introduction of products like the iPod in 2001, iPhone in 2007, iPad in 2010, Apple Watch in 2015, and a suite of complementary services including iTunes, the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. Today, Apple is renowned for its hardware products like the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, along with a robust services segment.</p>\n",
       "<p>Apple, Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino, California, at its Apple Park campus. The company operates globally, with a significant presence in the United States, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and the Rest of Asia Pacific.</p>\n",
       "<p>For the last reported quarter, which was the third quarter of fiscal 2023 ending on July 1, 2023, Apple generated revenues of \\$81.8 billion. The company\\&#x27;s EBITDA during this quarter was approximately \\$24.2 billion, equating to an EBITDA margin of 29.6%. As of the end of this fiscal quarter, Apple reported long-term debt of \\$98.6 billion on its balance sheet. Total leverage (defined as total debt to EBITDA) was approximately 1.0x, and net of the cash position (which was \\$55.9 billion in cash and marketable securities), Apple\\&#x27;s net leverage was approximately 0.64x. </p>\n",
