Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976, the company is renowned for designing, manufacturing, and marketing consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Its most notable hardware products include the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, iPod, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Appleâ€™s software includes macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS operating systems, as well as iTunes and the Safari web browser. Additionally, Apple offers a range of services such as the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay, catering to a global audience.</p>\\n\\n<p>In its latest quarterly financial report for Q3 FY 2023, Apple reported revenues of $81.8 billion, a slight decrease from the $83 billion in the same period of the previous year. The company\\'s EBITDA for this quarter was not explicitly broken down in its filings, but according to estimates, it stood at approximately $25 billion, translating to an EBITDA margin of roughly 30.5%.</p>\\n\\n<p>As of the end of Q3 FY 2023, Apple\\'s total debt on its balance sheet was approximately $111 billion. The company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $24 billion, resulting in a net debt of about $87 billion. This brings the total leverage to around 1.5 times EBITDA, considering net debt.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Sources</h3>\\n<ul>\\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/investor/quarterly-earnings/\">Apple Investor Quarterly Earnings</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000081/aapl-20230701.htm\">SEC Filings - Apple Inc.</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.appleresearch.com\">Apple Research Source</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n```\\n'"

       "<p>Banco de Sabadell, established in Spain, has actively pursued an expansion strategy through acquisitions and mergers to broaden its market footprint. Notably, in 2015, Sabadell completed the acquisition of TSB Banking Group in the United Kingdom, which marked a significant milestone in its international expansion efforts. This acquisition was aimed at increasing its presence in the UK market by leveraging TSB's infrastructure and client base. Over the years, Sabadell has also been involved in several other regional acquisitions to strengthen its domestic market position and diversify its financial offerings.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<h2>Type of Debt</h2>\n",
       "<p>Banco de Sabadell's debt structure primarily comprises secured and unsecured bonds, as well as interbank loans. A significant portion of the bankâ€™s debt is euro-denominated, reflecting its primary operations within the European market. However, for its international operations, such as TSB in the UK, it may have debt obligations in GBP. Based on the latest financial data, the total debt of â‚¬12.5 billion includes multiple tranches of bonds and other debt securities. When converted, this amounts to approximately USD 13.6 billion.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Credit Analyses by Rating Agencies</h2>\n",
       "<p>S&P Global, Fitch Ratings, and Moodyâ€™s provide regular credit assessments for Banco de Sabadell. As of the most recent reports, Moody's has rated Sabadellâ€™s long-term debt at Baa2, indicating a moderate credit risk with a stable outlook. Fitch Ratings issued a rating of BBB-, denoting that the bank's obligations are considered worthy of investment but are vulnerable to economic conditions. S&P similarly rated it at BB+, reflecting a rating just below investment grade, highlighting the need for consciousness of potential risk factors potentially impacted by external economic challenges. These agencies highlight Sabadell's solid business foundation and strong market presence while suggesting vigilance regarding macroeconomic challenges affecting the European banking sector.</p>\n",

In general, equity and total assets have shown an upward trend, signaling growth. Despite financial challenges, notable during 2020 attributed to broader economic conditions, the bank has sustained EBITDA growth and managed debt levels effectively.</p>\n",
       "<p>Specifically, higher intangibles/equity ratios indicate a significant portion of Sabadell's assets involve acquisitions and brand value. Also, the firm has improved its leverage position with reducing NFD/Equity and NFD/EBITDA ratios, reflecting enhanced financial stability and risk management. Its financial expenses relative to EBITDA highlight efficient interest management with a strong liquidity cushion. Recent quarters suggest reinforces focus on equity and earnings to support debt obligations efficiently.</p>\n",

       "<p>Banco de Sabadellâ€™s financial performance over recent years reflects a robust capability to generate free cash flow, an essential marker of financial resilience and capacity for growth. The Discretionary Free Cash Flow (FCF) shows an impressive upward trend from â‚¬323 million in 2019 to â‚¬779 million in 2022, emphasizing consistent enhancement of internal capital generation despite external economic turbulence, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The bank's disciplined management over capital expenditures, seen through reducing recurring investments and prudent renovations initiatives, allows for substantial Free Cash Flow. This financial prudence has greatly benefited its liquidity position, enabling the bank to maintain and even increase dividend payouts, as seen in the Discretionary FCF after Dividends metric.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Insights from the most recent quarter further illustrate resilience, as Sabadell's capacity to convert operational cash flows into free cash flows remains strong, indicative of an adaptive business model catering to evolving market demands while maintaining cost controls. It exhibits both strengths in capital efficiency and a robust foundation to support future strategic expansions and shareholder value enhancements.</p>\n",
