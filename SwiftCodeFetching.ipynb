      "A SWIFT code is a set of 8 or 11 digits that represents a bank branch. Youll need to use one when sending money internationally. \n",
      "Find your SWIFT code here\n",
      "Is a SWIFT code the same for all branches?\n",
      "Not every bank branch has a SWIFT code, which means you can usually use the code for the banks head office.\n",
      "Do I need an IBAN number as well?\n",
      "It depends on the country you're sending money to. In the Eurozone, you'll always need an IBAN and a SWIFT/BIC code. Banks in the USA use SWIFT codes, but they don't use IBANs. It's the same in New Zealand too. \n",
      "More on IBAN numbers\n",

Essentially you transfer money and it gets taken from your bank but no transfer is ever processed and it gets stuck 'sending' for months. Customer support is absolutely just buying time - I chatted with them every week and it's all variations of 'its a technical glitch, we will solve it tomorrow, we will message you with and update in 5 days'. But they never actually message you back. Now I have a message from. Them saying they will get back to me in 45days with an update.\n",

Essentially you transfer money and it gets taken from your bank but no transfer is ever processed and it gets stuck 'sending' for months. Customer support is absolutely just buying time - I chatted with them every week and it's all variations of 'its a technical glitch, we will solve it tomorrow, we will message you with and update in 5 days'. But they never actually message you back. Now I have a message from. Them saying they will get back to me in 45days with an update.\n",

      "Section 49 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Control Act of 1994 criminalizes money laundering related to narcotics trafficking. The offense is punishable by a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. However, Kenya has never seen a conviction for the laundering of proceeds from narcotics trafficking. Money laundering is a criminal offense, through a patchwork of laws and guidance that the GOK has cobbled together, including the 1994 Act, Legal Notice No. 4 of 2001, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Guidelines on Prevention of Money Laundering, and enabling provisions of other laws. Kenya has not developed an effective anti-money laundering (AML) regime. In November 2006, the GOK published a proposed Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, a revised version of a 2004 law. The proposed law declares itself to be An act of Parliament to provide for the offence of money laundering and to introduce measures for combating the offence, to provide for the identification, tracing, freezi ng, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime. It defines proceeds of crime as any property or economic advantage derived or realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of or in connection with an offence. The draft legislation provides for criminal and civil restraint, seizure and forfeiture. In addition, the proposed bill authorizes the establishment of an FIU and requires financial institutions and nonfinancial businesses or professions, including casinos, real estate agencies, precious metals and stones dealers, and legal professionals and accountants, to file suspicious transaction reports above a certain threshold. The bill also identifies 30 other statutes for the GOK to amend so that they will be consistent with the bill when it is passed. This bill has deficiencies. It does not mention terrorism, nor does it specifically define offense or crime. The proposed legislation does not explicitly authorize the seizure of legitimate businesses used to launder money. The requirement that only suspicious transactions above a certain threshold are reported is inconsistent with international standards, which call for suspicious transaction reports to have no monetary threshold. The GOK tabled the bill in Parliament in November 2007, but Parliament never took the bill up, and it lapsed when Parliament reces sed on December 8. The government will need to republish and resubmit the bill in the Tenth Parliamen t in 2008. The CBK is the regulatory and supervisory authority for Kenyas deposit-taking institutions and has oversight for more than 50 such entities, as well as mortgage companies and other financial institutions. The Minister of Home Affairs supervises casinos, although its regulation of this sector is ineffect ive. \n",
      " Money Launde ring and Financial Crimes \n",
      "291 CBK regulations require deposit-taking institutions to verify the identity of new customers  opening an account or conducting a transaction. The Banking Act amen dment of December 2001 authorizes the CBK to disclose financial information to any monetary or financial regulatory authority within or outside Kenya. In 2002, the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) issued guidelines requiring banks to report suspicious transactions to the CBK . These guidelines do not have the force of law, and only a handful of suspicious transactions have been reported so far. Under the regulations, banks must maintain records of transactions over U.S. $100,000 and international transfers over U.S. $50,000, and report them to the CBK. A law enforcement agency can demand information from any financial institution, if it has obtained a court order. Some commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus file suspicious transaction reports voluntarily, but they run the risk of civil litigation, as there are no adequate safe harbor provisions for reporting such transactions to the CBK. A court ruling to penalize a commercial bank in 2002 for disclosing information to the CBK  in response to a court order, made banks wary of reporting suspicious transactions. In a November 2007 decision that will likely further chill banks willingness to report suspicious transactions, a judge ordered Barcl ays Bank to pay a customer Kenya Shillings (Sh) 400,000 (approximately U.S. $6,107) for violating confidentiality by providing details on the customers  specimen signature to the British High Commission without her consent for processing a visa application. These regulations do not cover nonbank financial institutions such as money remitters, casinos, or investment companies, and there is no enforcement mech anism behind the regulations. Kenya lacks the institutional capacity, investigative skill and equipment to conduct complex investigations independently. There have been no arrests or prosecutions for money laundering or terrorist financing. There are 95 foreign exchange bureaus under GOK supervision. The Central Bank of Kenya Act (Cap 491) regulates forex bureaus, which are au\n",

      "Section 49 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Control Act of 1994 criminalizes money laundering related to narcotics trafficking. The offense is punishable by a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. However, Kenya has never seen a conviction for the laundering of proceeds from narcotics trafficking. Money laundering is a criminal offense, through a patchwork of laws and guidance that the GOK has cobbled together, including the 1994 Act, Legal Notice No. 4 of 2001, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Guidelines on Prevention of Money Laundering, and enabling provisions of other laws. Kenya has not developed an effective anti-money laundering (AML) regime. In November 2006, the GOK published a proposed Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, a revised version of a 2004 law. The proposed law declares itself to be An act of Parliament to provide for the offence of money laundering and to introduce measures for combating the offence, to provide for the identification, tracing, freezi ng, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime. It defines proceeds of crime as any property or economic advantage derived or realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of or in connection with an offence. The draft legislation provides for criminal and civil restraint, seizure and forfeiture. In addition, the proposed bill authorizes the establishment of an FIU and requires financial institutions and nonfinancial businesses or professions, including casinos, real estate agencies, precious metals and stones dealers, and legal professionals and accountants, to file suspicious transaction reports above a certain threshold. The bill also identifies 30 other statutes for the GOK to amend so that they will be consistent with the bill when it is passed. This bill has deficiencies. It does not mention terrorism, nor does it specifically define offense or crime. The proposed legislation does not explicitly authorize the seizure of legitimate businesses used to launder money. The requirement that only suspicious transactions above a certain threshold are reported is inconsistent with international standards, which call for suspicious transaction reports to have no monetary threshold. The GOK tabled the bill in Parliament in November 2007, but Parliament never took the bill up, and it lapsed when Parliament reces sed on December 8. The government will need to republish and resubmit the bill in the Tenth Parliamen t in 2008. The CBK is the regulatory and supervisory authority for Kenyas deposit-taking institutions and has oversight for more than 50 such entities, as well as mortgage companies and other financial institutions. The Minister of Home Affairs supervises casinos, although its regulation of this sector is ineffect ive. \n",
      " Money Launde ring and Financial Crimes \n",
      "291 CBK regulations require deposit-taking institutions to verify the identity of new customers  opening an account or conducting a transaction. The Banking Act amen dment of December 2001 authorizes the CBK to disclose financial information to any monetary or financial regulatory authority within or outside Kenya. In 2002, the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) issued guidelines requiring banks to report suspicious transactions to the CBK . These guidelines do not have the force of law, and only a handful of suspicious transactions have been reported so far. Under the regulations, banks must maintain records of transactions over U.S. $100,000 and international transfers over U.S. $50,000, and report them to the CBK. A law enforcement agency can demand information from any financial institution, if it has obtained a court order. Some commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus file suspicious transaction reports voluntarily, but they run the risk of civil litigation, as there are no adequate safe harbor provisions for reporting such transactions to the CBK. A court ruling to penalize a commercial bank in 2002 for disclosing information to the CBK  in response to a court order, made banks wary of reporting suspicious transactions. In a November 2007 decision that will likely further chill banks willingness to report suspicious transactions, a judge ordered Barcl ays Bank to pay a customer Kenya Shillings (Sh) 400,000 (approximately U.S. $6,107) for violating confidentiality by providing details on the customers  specimen signature to the British High Commission without her consent for processing a visa application. These regulations do not cover nonbank financial institutions such as money remitters, casinos, or investment companies, and there is no enforcement mech anism behind the regulations. Kenya lacks the institutional capacity, investigative skill and equipment to conduct complex investigations independently. There have been no arrests or prosecutions for money laundering or terrorist financing. There are 95 foreign exchange bureaus under GOK supervision. The Central Bank of Kenya Act (Cap 491) regulates forex bureaus, which are auText portion that matches the swift code patter: 1. MIDLPAPA001\n",

      "Wire transfers\n",
      ", on the other hand, are speedier. They zip directly between banks, often on the same business day, sometimes even instantly. But for this privilege, you'll pay a fee, typically ranging from $25 to $50. So, wire transfers are ideal for urgent transactions or international transfers that ACH can't handle.\n",

      "ACH (Automated Clearing House) transfers\n",

      "Wire transfers\n",
      ", on the other hand, are speedier. They zip directly between banks, often on the same business day, sometimes even instantly. But for this privilege, you'll pay a fee, typically ranging from $25 to $50. So, wire transfers are ideal for urgent transactions or international transfers that ACH can't handle.\n",

      "SECRECY ACT \n",
      "The Financial Recordkeeping and Reporting of Currency and Foreign Transactions Act of 1970 (31 U.S.C. 5311 et seq.) is referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).  The purpose of the BSA is to require United States (U.S.) financial institutions to maintain appropriate records and file certain reports involving currency transactions and a financial institutions customer relationships.  Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are the primary means used by banks to satisfy the requirements of the BSA.  The recordkeeping regulations also include the requirement that a financial institutions records be sufficient to enable transactions and activity in customer accounts to be reconstructed if necessary.  In doing so, a paper and audit trail is maintained.  These records and reports have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.    The BSA consists of two parts:  Title I Financial Recordkeeping and Title II Reports of Currency and Foreign Transactions.  Title I authorizes the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to issue regulations, which require insured financial institutions to maintain certain records.  Title II directed the Treasury to prescribe regulations governing the reporting of certain transactions by and through financial institutions in excess of $10,000 into, out of, and within the U.S.  The Treasurys implementing regulations under the BSA, issued within the provisions of 31 CFR Part 103, are included in the FDICs Rules and Regulations and on the FDIC website.   The implementing regulations under the BSA were originally intended to aid investigations into an array of criminal activities, from income tax evasion to money laundering.  In recent years, the reports and records prescribed by the BSA have also been utilized as tools for investigating individuals suspected of engaging in illegal drug and terrorist financing activities.  Law enforcement agencies have found CTRs to be extremely valuable in tracking the huge amounts of cash generated by individuals and entities for illicit purposes.  SARs, used by financial institutions to report identified or suspected illicit or unusual activities, are likewise extremely valuable to law enforcement agencies.    Several acts and regulations expanding and strengthening the scope and enforcement of the BSA, anti-money laundering (AML) measures, and counter-terrorist financing measures have been signed into law and issued, respectively, over the past several decades.  Several of these acts include:  \n",
      " Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, \n",
      " Annuzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992, \n",
      " Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, and \n",
      " Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act \n",
      "of 1998. \n",
      " Most recently, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (more commonly known as the USA PATRIOT Act) was swiftly enacted by Congress in October 2001, primarily in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S.  The USA PATRIOT Act established a host of new measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute those involved in money laundering and terrorist financing.   \n",

A currency transaction is any transaction involving the physical transfer of currency from one person to another and covers deposits, withdrawals, exchanges, or transfers of currency or other payments.  Currency is defined as currency and coin of the U.S. or any other country as long as it is customarily accepted as money in the country of issue.  Multiple currency transactions shall be treated as a single transaction if the financial institution has knowledge that the transactions are by, or on behalf of, any person and result in either cash in or cash out totaling more than $10,000 during any one business day.

      "SECRECY ACT \n",
      "The Financial Recordkeeping and Reporting of Currency and Foreign Transactions Act of 1970 (31 U.S.C. 5311 et seq.) is referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).  The purpose of the BSA is to require United States (U.S.) financial institutions to maintain appropriate records and file certain reports involving currency transactions and a financial institutions customer relationships.  Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are the primary means used by banks to satisfy the requirements of the BSA.  The recordkeeping regulations also include the requirement that a financial institutions records be sufficient to enable transactions and activity in customer accounts to be reconstructed if necessary.  In doing so, a paper and audit trail is maintained.  These records and reports have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.    The BSA consists of two parts:  Title I Financial Recordkeeping and Title II Reports of Currency and Foreign Transactions.  Title I authorizes the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to issue regulations, which require insured financial institutions to maintain certain records.  Title II directed the Treasury to prescribe regulations governing the reporting of certain transactions by and through financial institutions in excess of $10,000 into, out of, and within the U.S.  The Treasurys implementing regulations under the BSA, issued within the provisions of 31 CFR Part 103, are included in the FDICs Rules and Regulations and on the FDIC website.   The implementing regulations under the BSA were originally intended to aid investigations into an array of criminal activities, from income tax evasion to money laundering.  In recent years, the reports and records prescribed by the BSA have also been utilized as tools for investigating individuals suspected of engaging in illegal drug and terrorist financing activities.  Law enforcement agencies have found CTRs to be extremely valuable in tracking the huge amounts of cash generated by individuals and entities for illicit purposes.  SARs, used by financial institutions to report identified or suspected illicit or unusual activities, are likewise extremely valuable to law enforcement agencies.    Several acts and regulations expanding and strengthening the scope and enforcement of the BSA, anti-money laundering (AML) measures, and counter-terrorist financing measures have been signed into law and issued, respectively, over the past several decades.  Several of these acts include:  \n",
      " Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, \n",
      " Annuzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992, \n",
      " Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, and \n",
      " Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act \n",
      "of 1998. \n",
      " Most recently, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (more commonly known as the USA PATRIOT Act) was swiftly enacted by Congress in October 2001, primarily in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S.  The USA PATRIOT Act established a host of new measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute those involved in money laundering and terrorist financing.   \n",

      "U.S. financial institutions must file a CTR, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Form 104 (formerly known as Internal Revenue Service [IRS] Form 4789), for each currency transaction over $10,000.  A currency transaction is any transaction involving the physical transfer of currency from one person to another and covers deposits, withdrawals, exchanges, or transfers of currency or other payments.  Currency is defined as currency and coin of the U.S. or any other country as long as it is customarily accepted as money in the country of issue.  Multiple currency transactions shall be treated as a single transaction if the financial institution has knowledge that the transactions are by, or on behalf of, any person and result in either cash in or cash out totaling more than $10,000 during any one business day.  Transactions at all branches of a financial institution should be aggregated when determining reportable multiple transactions.  \n",

      "What are SWIFT codes?\n",
      "A SWIFT code is a set of 8 or 11 digits that represents a bank branch. Youll need to use one when sending money internationally. \n",
      "Find your SWIFT code here\n",
      "Is a SWIFT code the same for all branches?\n",
      "Not every bank branch has a SWIFT code, which means you can usually use the code for the banks head office.\n",
      "Do I need an IBAN number as well?\n",
      "It depends on the country you're sending money to. In the Eurozone, you'll always need an IBAN and a SWIFT/BIC code. Banks in the USA use SWIFT codes, but they don't use IBANs. It's the same in New Zealand too. \n",

      "    My wife and I have been using Marcus' high yield savings account to save up a downpayment over the past few years and felt safe because GS is such a big name. We were set to close earlier this week and had major issues wiring the money. First, they don't allow wiring to external accounts meaning we could not send directly to the title company; we had to send the money to our regular checking first. This was not a big deal as we understand it's to protect against fraud. But once we wired the money, we were told it takes one to three business \n",
      " to be delivered and consequently, we missed our closing date despite initiating the wire a day and a half before close.\n",
      "    My biggest gripe is that the app says wires will typically be delivered in one hour but when you call and speak to a service rep, they'll tell you it's actually up to 3 days. And ours took the entire three days to be delivered. Multiple reps told us there were no issues with our money or our account, just that it was stuck in the \"money mover\" department and was \"processing\".\n",

We were set to close earlier this week and had major issues wiring the money. First, they don't allow wiring to external accounts meaning we could not send directly to the title company; we had to send the money to our regular checking first. This was not a big deal as we understand it's to protect against fraud. But once we wired the money, we were told it takes one to three business \n",
      " to be delivered and consequently, we missed our closing date despite initiating the wire a day and a half before close.\n",
      "    My biggest gripe is that the app says wires will typically be delivered in one hour but when you call and speak to a service rep, they'll tell you it's actually up to 3 days. And ours took the entire three days to be delivered. Multiple reps told us there were no issues with our money or our account, just that it was stuck in the \"money mover\" department and was \"processing\".\n",

      "    TLDR; Wise acts like theyre unable to locate your ACH transfer in order to hold on to your money as long as possible. Also, TrustPilot cant be trusted. Big surprise.\n",
      "    We planned to purchase $10k in 3D printers from a Chinese supplier that wanted the money via international transfer. So be it, its pretty standard and they are a well known company.\n",
      "    That being said, the small business bank account we used (Novo) didnt have anything for international transfers so I decided to go with Wise for that. They had good reviews on TrustPilot (never trust TrustPilot!) so I thought we were good.\n",
      "    We transferred the money to our Wise account to then transfer overseas. 3 days go by, money never shows so I contact them. They state it can take up to 5 business days (ACHs usually happen within 2 days max).\n",
      "    5 days go by and nothing. I contact them a few days later and they ask me for my transaction info to track the ACH. I provide it and another 6 business days go by with no response. At this point our supplier is getting antsy, prices are increasing and were going to lose our price. I start getting worried.\n",
      "    Then I see the reviews on their Google Business and other sites hundreds of reviews reporting Wise is holding their money for months. Each person reporting 10s of thousands of dollars missing. Their accounts getting closed and Wise claiming they cant track the money. The TrustPilot reviews were fake bot reviews.\n",
      "    So at this point, I freak out and contact them. Tell them Ill be filing reports with the relevant agencies if I dont at least get some information on the whereabouts of my money. I mean, its a domestic ACH.. pretty standard thing! Radio silence.\n",
      "    I wait awhile longer and at this point 30 days in and I had talked to 4 different reps on the phone (3 of which hung up on me after pretending to transfer me) and 20+ emails back and forth getting no where. So, I filed a report with the CFPD which requires the business to respond within 2 weeks to the report. The very last day, they respond that they were able to track the money and a refund has been issued. Money showed up 3 days later.\n",
      "    We lost our pricing on the 3D printers but were relieved to get the money back. Expensive mistake.\n",

      "    We planned to purchase $10k in 3D printers from a Chinese supplier that wanted the money via international transfer. So be it, its pretty standard and they are a well known company.\n",
      "    That being said, the small business bank account we used (Novo) didnt have anything for international transfers so I decided to go with Wise for that. They had good reviews on TrustPilot (never trust TrustPilot!) so I thought we were good.\n",
      "    We transferred the money to our Wise account to then transfer overseas. 3 days go by, money never shows so I contact them. They state it can take up to 5 business days (ACHs usually happen within 2 days max).\n",
      "    5 days go by and nothing. I contact them a few days later and they ask me for my transaction info to track the ACH. I provide it and another 6 business days go by with no response. At this point our supplier is getting antsy, prices are increasing and were going to lose our price. I start getting worried.\n",
      "    Then I see the reviews on their Google Business and other sites hundreds of reviews reporting Wise is holding their money for months. Each person reporting 10s of thousands of dollars missing. Their accounts getting closed and Wise claiming they cant track the money. The TrustPilot reviews were fake bot reviews.\n",
      "    So at this point, I freak out and contact them. Tell them Ill be filing reports with the relevant agencies if I dont at least get some information on the whereabouts of my money. I mean, its a domestic ACH.. pretty standard thing! Radio silence.\n",
      "    I wait awhile longer and at this point 30 days in and I had talked to 4 different reps on the phone (3 of which hung up on me after pretending to transfer me) and 20+ emails back and forth getting no where. So, I filed a report with the CFPD which requires the business to respond within 2 weeks to the report. The very last day, they respond that they were able to track the money and a refund has been issued. Money showed up 3 days later.\n",
      "    We lost our pricing on the 3D printers but were relieved to get the money back. Expensive mistake.\n",

      "International:\n",
      " If you send a wire transfer from your personal account, you have 30 minutes after you authorize the wire to cancel it. To cancel a wire transfer, look for it in your Wire activity and choose \"Cancel\" in the Action column. You'll only see \"Cancel\" next to a wire if you're able to cancel it.\n",
      "Note:\n",
      " Recovery of your money is very unlikely if you send money by mistake or due to a scam. Once you send a wire, you can't cancel it.\n",
      "Why was my wire returned?\n",
      "A wire can be returned for several reasons:\n",
      "The wrong account number was provided to the recipient bank\n",
      "Wire is missing bank or country-specific information (e.g. statement of payment purpose for an international wire)\n",
      "If any information in the \"Message to recipient bank\" field conflicts with bank records (e.g. wrong account number or name)\n",
      "Recipient name provided doesn't match recipient bank's records\n",
      "Your wire may be returned with a lesser amount for several reasons:\n",
      "Recipient bank and/or intermediary bank has deducted processing fees\n",
      "The exchange rate at the time of the return wire was different than the exchange rate of the initial wire\n",

      "Where can I send money and what currencies can I send?\n",
      "You can send money to more than 90 countries and more than 40 different currencies. Federal regulations place some restrictions on where you can send a wire. Currency options are specific to the country to which money is being wired.\n",

      "What is a guaranteed exchange rate?\n",
      "For foreign exchange wires, an exchange rate will be shown in the send flow prior to authorizing your wire and will be guaranteed for 30 minutes. There will be a counter within the wire summary telling you how long you have until your rate expires and a new rate is locked in for another 30 minutes. We apply our exchange rate once you submit your transaction.\n",
      "What's a SWIFT code?\n",

      "    Hi! I had an experience with wise that seems to be pretty wide spread. Essentially you transfer money and it gets taken from your bank but no transfer is ever processed and it gets stuck 'sending' for months. Customer support is absolutely just buying time - I chatted with them every week and it's all variations of 'its a technical glitch, we will solve it tomorrow, we will message you with and update in 5 days'. But they never actually message you back. Now I have a message from. Them saying they will get back to me in 45days with an update.\n",
      "    This issue seems to be more and more common and funds will only be released if legal action is taken.\n",
      "    Just a warning for nomads. Wise is malfunctioning.\n",
      "    EDIT: Shortly after disputing the transaction through my bank, wise changed the 'sending' status to 'cancelled'. No money has yet been refunded to me at this point. My wise account has not been closed or restricted.\n",

      "What are SWIFT codes?\n",
      "A SWIFT code is a set of 8 or 11 digits that represents a bank branch. Youll need to use one when sending money internationally. \n",
      "Find your SWIFT code here\n",
      "Is a SWIFT code the same for all branches?\n",
      "Not every bank branch has a SWIFT code, which means you can usually use the code for the banks head office.\n",
      "Do I need an IBAN number as well?\n",
      "It depends on the country you're sending money to. In the Eurozone, you'll always need an IBAN and a SWIFT/BIC code. Banks in the USA use SWIFT codes, but they don't use IBANs. It's the same in New Zealand too. \n",

      "What are SWIFT codes?\n",
      "A SWIFT code is a set of 8 or 11 digits that represents a bank branch. Youll need to use one when sending money internationally. \n",
      "Find your SWIFT code here\n",
      "Is a SWIFT code the same for all branches?\n",
      "Not every bank branch has a SWIFT code, which means you can usually use the code for the banks head office.\n",
      "Do I need an IBAN number as well?\n",
      "It depends on the country you're sending money to. In the Eurozone, you'll always need an IBAN and a SWIFT/BIC code. Banks in the USA use SWIFT codes, but they don't use IBANs. It's the same in New Zealand too. \n",

      "A SWIFT code is a set of 8 or 11 digits that represents a bank branch. Youll need to use one when sending money internationally. \n",
      "Find your SWIFT code here\n",
      "Is a SWIFT code the same for all branches?\n",
      "Not every bank branch has a SWIFT code, which means you can usually use the code for the banks head office.\n",
      "Do I need an IBAN number as well?\n",
      "It depends on the country you're sending money to. In the Eurozone, you'll always need an IBAN and a SWIFT/BIC code. Banks in the USA use SWIFT codes, but they don't use IBANs. It's the same in New Zealand too. \n",
      "More on IBAN numbers\n",

      "What are SWIFT codes?\n",
      "A SWIFT code is a set of 8 or 11 digits that represents a bank branch. Youll need to use one when sending money internationally. \n",
      "Find your SWIFT code here\n",
      "Is a SWIFT code the same for all branches?\n",
      "Not every bank branch has a SWIFT code, which means you can usually use the code for the banks head office.\n",
      "Do I need an IBAN number as well?\n",
      "It depends on the country you're sending money to. In the Eurozone, you'll always need an IBAN and a SWIFT/BIC code. Banks in the USA use SWIFT codes, but they don't use IBANs. It's the same in New Zealand too. \n",

      "Renowned the world over for its stability, confidentiality, and trust in safeguarding assets, the Swiss banking system has earned a legendary reputation in many people's minds today.\n",
      "Although these stereotypes have a grain of truth, Swiss banks today are significantly more transparent than they used to be, and their seizure-proof and anonymous status is essentially no longer true. In fact, most non-residents seeking to open a bank account in Switzerland today are cross-border commuters simply interested in receiving a salary from their Swiss employer rather than shady tycoons trying to hide their money from their home country's tax authorities.\n",
      "In this article, we'll start by dispelling many common misconceptions about Swiss banking. Next, we'll introduce you to your options when opening a bank account in Switzerland, regardless of whether you have a residence permit.\n",

      "Many non-Swiss residents find opening a bank account in Switzerland particularly tricky because most Swiss banks require you to be a Swiss citizen, permanent resident, or at least a cross-border commuter to approve your application.\n",
      "All told, there are \n",
      "three main paths\n",
      " to open a bank account online in Switzerland, and the best Swiss bank account will depend heavily on your needs and preferences. These paths are as follows:\n",
      "Traditional Swiss banks:\n",
      " This path requires proof of Swiss residence and is only open to non-residents who make significant investments or work in Switzerland but live in a neighbouring country. It's best for those who want extensive banking services and don't mind the fees.\n",
      "Swiss neobanks:\n",
      " Here, you at least need to live in an EU country neighbouring Switzerland. It's the best path if you want low-cost, digital banking services and don't mind slightly less banking coverage.\n",
      "Multi-currency accounts:\n",
      " This path allows you to hold CHF as an online balance without any bank account. This path is available in many countries globally.\n",

      "Despite no longer allowing you to stash away your fortunes anonymously, Swiss banks offer many distinct advantages for non-residents in the country.\n",
      "For wealthier individuals, for example, Swiss bank accounts are often perceived as attractive because they are credited in Swiss francs (CHF), a \"safe haven\" currency that has historically proven to be comparatively stable during times of global economic distress.\n",
      "Swiss bank accounts are also an attractive deal for the nearly 350 thousand EU citizens working in Switzerland while living just across the border. Because all salaries in Switzerland are paid in Swiss francs, and because Swiss employers practically only pay their workers into Swiss bank accounts, opening an account in the country is often easy for cross-border workers. Not only is it easy, but it's also helpful, as cross-border workers can avoid high currency conversion fees when being paid while also largely dodging exchange rate risk.\n",

      "Renowned the world over for its stability, confidentiality, and trust in safeguarding assets, the Swiss banking system has earned a legendary reputation in many people's minds today.\n",
      "Although these stereotypes have a grain of truth, Swiss banks today are significantly more transparent than they used to be, and their seizure-proof and anonymous status is essentially no longer true. In fact, most non-residents seeking to open a bank account in Switzerland today are cross-border commuters simply interested in receiving a salary from their Swiss employer rather than shady tycoons trying to hide their money from their home country's tax authorities.\n",
      "In this article, we'll start by dispelling many common misconceptions about Swiss banking. Next, we'll introduce you to your options when opening a bank account in Switzerland, regardless of whether you have a residence permit.\n",

      "compare top Swiss neobanks\n",
      "Many non-Swiss residents find opening a bank account in Switzerland particularly tricky because most Swiss banks require you to be a Swiss citizen, permanent resident, or at least a cross-border commuter to approve your application.\n",
      "All told, there are \n",
      "three main paths\n",
      " to open a bank account online in Switzerland, and the best Swiss bank account will depend heavily on your needs and preferences. These paths are as follows:\n",
      "Traditional Swiss banks:\n",
      " This path requires proof of Swiss residence and is only open to non-residents who make significant investments or work in Switzerland but live in a neighbouring country. It's best for those who want extensive banking services and don't mind the fees.\n",
      "Swiss neobanks:\n",
      " Here, you at least need to live in an EU country neighbouring Switzerland. It's the best path if you want low-cost, digital banking services and don't mind slightly less banking coverage.\n",
      "Multi-currency accounts:\n",
      " This path allows you to hold CHF as an online balance without any bank account. This path is available in many countries globally.\n",

      "Despite no longer allowing you to stash away your fortunes anonymously, Swiss banks offer many distinct advantages for non-residents in the country.\n",
      "For wealthier individuals, for example, Swiss bank accounts are often perceived as attractive because they are credited in Swiss francs (CHF), a \"safe haven\" currency that has historically proven to be comparatively stable during times of global economic distress.\n",
      "Swiss bank accounts are also an attractive deal for the nearly 350 thousand EU citizens working in Switzerland while living just across the border. Because all salaries in Switzerland are paid in Swiss francs, and because Swiss employers practically only pay their workers into Swiss bank accounts, opening an account in the country is often easy for cross-border workers. Not only is it easy, but it's also helpful, as cross-border workers can avoid high currency conversion fees when being paid while also largely dodging exchange rate risk.\n",

      "It depends on the country you're sending money to. In the Eurozone, you'll always need an IBAN and a SWIFT/BIC code. Banks in the USA use SWIFT codes, but they don't use IBANs. It's the same in New Zealand too. \n",

      "What are SWIFT codes?\n",
      "A SWIFT code is a set of 8 or 11 digits that represents a bank branch. Youll need to use one when sending money internationally. \n",
      "Find your SWIFT code here\n",
      "Is a SWIFT code the same for all branches?\n",
      "Not every bank branch has a SWIFT code, which means you can usually use the code for the banks head office.\n",
      "Do I need an IBAN number as well?\n",
      "It depends on the country you're sending money to. In the Eurozone, you'll always need an IBAN and a SWIFT/BIC code. Banks in the USA use SWIFT codes, but they don't use IBANs. It's the same in New Zealand too. \n",
